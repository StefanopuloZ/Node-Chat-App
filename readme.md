- This project follows Udemy course from Andrew Mead

https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/

and this part focuses on Socket.io. It is much shorter then Todo App from the same course and it does not dive as deep in sockets as it could. It has helped me learn basics, but I still did not get chance to implement it in my personal projects which will change soon, I hope. I recommend this whole course for everyone who want to learn backend technologies using Node.js though.
